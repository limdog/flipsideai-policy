    <h1>Privacy Policy for Flipside AI</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 26, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy outlines how Flipside AI ("we", "our", or "us") uses and protects data when connecting to
        Google services via our automation platform, hosted at <strong>https://workflows.flipsideai.au/</strong>.</p>

    <h2>2. Data We Access</h2>
    <p>To provide automation services for our clients, our application requires access to certain Google user data. The
        specific data required depends on the services being automated (e.g., Google Sheets, Gmail, Google Drive). We
        only request the minimum necessary permissions ("scopes") to perform the designated tasks for our clients.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Data</h2>
    <p>Google user data is used exclusively to execute the automated workflows configured for our clients. This includes
        reading, writing, and modifying data in the connected Google services as required by the workflow's logic.
        Authentication tokens are stored securely within our n8n instance to maintain the connection with Google's
        servers.</p>

    <h2>4. How We Share Data</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share any Google user data with third parties. All data is handled strictly for the purpose of
        running the client's configured automations.</p>

    <h2>5. Adherence to Google Policies</h2>
    <p>Our use and transfer of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the <a
            href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#limited-use-requirements"
            target="_blank">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at <strong>lucas@flipsideai.au</strong>.
